## About
### About Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix is a simple table that separates cases by importance and urgency. It allows you to prioritize tasks, helps you plan your work and free time. The matrix is suitable for both work and family affairs â€” for example, for organizing repairs or moving.

Developed by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

### About Project
I transferred this world-famous time management method to Telegram based on the aiogram library. Now the project has the opportunity to add a to-do list, sorting it by importance and urgency, and fully manage it. You no longer need to use a notepad to compose your Eisenhower Matrix.
